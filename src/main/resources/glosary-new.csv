Ball change,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_change,"Ball change is a dance move that consists of two steps: or a partial weight transfer on the ball of a foot behind or by the other foot, followed by a step on the other foot. This action has a syncopated feeling and counted &1, or &2, or a1, or a2, etc., i.e., the 'ball' step splits off the end of a beat. It is used, e.g., in the kick ball change."
Basic figure,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Basic_movement,Same as Basic movement
Basic movement,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_movement_(dance),Basic movement is the very basic step that defines the character of a dance. Often it is called just thus: 'Basic Movement' or 'Basic Step'. For some dances it is sufficient to know the basic step performed in different handholds and dance positions to enjoy it socially.

Box step,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Step,"Box Step is a dance figure named so because the steps rest in the four corners of a square. It is used, e.g., in American Style ballroom dances: Rumba bronze-level Foxtrot. The leader begins with the left foot and proceeds as follows. First half-box: Forward-side-together .Second half-box: Backwards-side-together. Every step is with full weight transfer. During the second and fourth step it is advised the foot to travel along two sides of the box, rather than along its diagonal.Rhythm varies. E.g., it is '1-2-3,4-5-6' in Waltz and 'Sqq, Sqq' in Rumba."
Chaines / Chain turns / Chaines turns,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_ballet_terms#Cha.C3.AEn.C3.A9s,"French for 'chain', a series of quick turns on first position alternating feet with progression along a straight line or circle."
Chasse,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasse,"Chasse is a dance step with a triple step pattern used in many forms of dance. It is a gliding, flowing step with the feet essentially following a step together step pattern. Timing and length of steps vary from dance to dance."
Closed change,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_and_Open_Changes,"Closed Change is a basic step in the Waltz. The man steps forward on either foot whilst the lady steps backward on the opposing foot (e.g.: the man steps forward on his right foot whilst the lady steps back on her left). They will then step to the side on the other foot, and conclude the figure by closing the first foot beside the second (hence the name 'closed' of the step). Each step takes up a full beat of the music."
Cross-body lead,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-body_lead,"Cross-body lead (CBL) is a common and useful move in Latin dances such as Salsa, Mambo, Rumba and Cha-cha-cha. Basically, the man on counts 2 and 3 of his basic step (assuming dancing on 1) does a quarter-left turn (90Â° counterclockwise) while still holding on to the woman. On counts 4 and 5, he leads the woman forward across him, i.e., firmly leads her with his right hand on her back, so that she travels across and turns around and faces the opposite direction she was facing. At the same time, the man does another quarter-left turn as necessary in order to follow the woman and face her. At the end of the move, the dancers have their positions exchanged. The cross-body lead can be done with single-hand or double hand hold, with or without a woman's underarm turn, or leading the woman to do a free spin."
Dosado,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosado,"Dosado is a circular movement where two people, who are initially facing each other, walk around each other without or almost without turning, i.e., facing in the same direction (same wall) all the time."
Enchufla,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_(dance),"This is a dance movement common in salsa, where the two dance partners facing each other change positions.

Heel turn,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_foot,"A ballroom dance move, which is the turn on the heel of the support foot while the other foot is held close and parallel to the support one. At the end of the turn the weight is transferred from one foot to another.[1]"

Inside partner step,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_partner_dance_terms#Track_of_foot,"A step taken forward into the space occupied by the partner, while the partner steps backwards. During this step feet tracks of both partners overlap. See also #Outside partner step."
Inside turn,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Inside_turn,"The term is applied to an individual turn of a partner in the couple. Basically, it denotes a turn where the arm of the partner doing the turn begins by moving towards the 'inside' of the couple (the line running from the center of one partner to the center of the other). The meaning is intuitively clear, but it may be performed in numerous ways and in different handholds, so that even accomplished dancers are confused. In dances such as swing and salsa, inside and outside turns most commonly refer to underarm turns done by the follower. Since in these dances the follower's right arm is normally used to lead a turn (most commonly by the leader's left arm, but sometimes by the leader's right arm when a cross-hand or 'handshake' position is used), an inside turn is normally a left (counter-clockwise) turn, while an outside turn is a right (clockwise) turn. However, if the follower's left arm is used to initiate the turn, the intended direction of turning may be opposite. (Alternatively, the non-ambiguous terms 'left turn' and 'right turn' may be used.)"
Kick,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick,"Kick is a foot and lower leg action that imitates a kick, e.g., of the ball. Its style may vary from light flick to a kick in martial arts."
Lock,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_step_(dance),"A Lock step is an alternative variation of a chasse action which occurs when the moving foot swings to a stop across the track of the standing foot rather than closing next to it. In the Latin dances the combination of the crossed position and the turnout of the feet means that the rear toe will be pointed at the heel of the other foot, while in the Standard dances the lack of turnout means the feet will be parallel. In Standard the basic locking action is usually preceded and followed by a left side lead. The Latin lock step is often featured when Cha-cha is danced in Open position with a one-hand hold."
Moonwalk,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonwalk_(dance),The Moonwalk is a dance technique that presents the illusion of the dancer being pulled backwards while attempting to walk forward.

Outside partner step,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_partner_dance_terms#Moving_foot,"A step taken with the partner beside the moving foot (e.g., to the left of the left moving foot). During this step feet tracks of both partners do not overlap. See also #Inside partner step."
Outside turn,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Inside_turn,"The term is applied to an individual turn of a partner in the couple. Basically, it denotes the lead/follow connection directed ""outside"" of the center of the spinning individual. Inside and Outside terminology can not be determined by relativity to partnership as such position alternates every 180 degrees of rotation. Connection points and application of active side are consistent only with regard to the axis of rotation and direction of spin."
Reverse turn,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_reverse_turns,Reverse turns and some other figures are those in which the dance couple rotates to the left (counterclockwise).
Rond,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet_glossary#Rond_de_jambe,See Ballet glossary#Rond de jambe. A toe of the straight leg draws a semicircle on the floor. In ballroom dances the direction is usually from the front to back.

Time Step,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Steps_(Cha-cha-cha),"In tap dancing, the Time Step is a recognizable rhythmic tap combination. The term comes from the time of great tap dancers that used their distinctive Time Step to tell the band the desired tempo.Time Steps is a figure in International Style Cha-cha-cha.In various rhythmic ballroom/social dances, Time Step sometimes refers to steps in place that mark the characteristic rhythm of the dance, ""2-3-cha-cha-cha"" for Cha-cha-cha, ""1,2,3,4"" for Paso Doble, ""1,2,3,...5,6,7,..."" for ""Salsa on One"", etc..In tap, the common time steps are classified as single, double and triple. The basic rhythm and tempo remain the same but the number of sounds that happen on the second and sixth count of an eight-count phrase denotes single (often a single step) double (usually a flap or slap-tap) or triple (commonly shuffle-step). While these are the universal time steps, dancers often choose to create their own time steps, following the pattern two bars repeated three times with a two bar break."
Walk,http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Walk_(dance_move)&action=edit&redlink=1,"The Walk is probably the most basic dance move. It exists in almost every dance. Walks approximately correspond normal walking steps, taking into the account the basic technique of the dance in question. (For example, in Latin dance walks the toe hits the floor first, rather than the heel.) In dance descriptions the term walk is usually applied when two or more steps are taken in the same direction. A single step, e.g., forward, is called just thus: 'step forward'. Waalks can be done in various dance positions : in closed position, promenade position, shadow position, sweetheart position, etc. Curved walks are done along a curve, rather than along a straight line"
