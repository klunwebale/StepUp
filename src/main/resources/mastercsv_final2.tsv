To be able to improvise, the dancer needs to learn the lead and implementation of the different single elements of Tango, so they can be produced later by leading appropriately in space and music. The elements are just a few as - caminar (walk), - cruce (cross), - ochos (figure-eight), - ganchos (leg hooks), - giros (turns), - contragiros (turns in the other direction), - sacadas (displacements), - boleos (this expression comes from boleadoras, - balls linked with cords, thrown to hunt animals), - llevadas de pie (moving foot by foot), - cortes (cuts), and - quebradas (breaks).	4 beats in each bar (measure)	30-32 beats per minute	Slow, Slow, Quick, Quick, Slow	Argentine	Gabriel Rivano;Ignacio Corsini;Pablo Elorza	Basic Corte;Change of Places;Closed Promenade;Contra Rock;Contra Rock to Reverse Pivot;Cross Body Lead to Triple Swivel;Gancho to Outside Swivel;Left-Turning Rock;Open Left Turn;Open Left Turn to Outside Swivel;Open Promenade ;Outside Swivel;Progressive Rocks;Promenade Pivot;Promenade Release to Open Fan;Promenade Release to Underarm Turn Left;Promenade With Left Swivel;Promenade With Right Turn;Rock to Promenade;Shadow Rocks
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bachata_(dance)	Bachata (dance)	Bachata	Latin dances	NA	"Bachata is a style of dance that originated in the Dominican Republic. It is danced widely all over the world but not identically. The basics to the dance are three-step with a Cuban hip motion, followed by a tap including a hip movement on the 4th beat. The knees should be slightly bent so the performer can sway the hips easier. Generally, most of the dancer's movement is in the lower body up to the hips, and the upper body moves much less. In partnering, the lead can decide whether to perform in open or closed position. Dance moves, or step variety, during performance strongly depends on the music (such as the rhythms played by the different instruments), setting, mood, and interpretation. Unlike Salsa, Bachata dance does not usually include complex turn patterns but they are used more and more as the dance evolves. The leading is done just like in most other social dances, with a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“pushing and pullingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ hand and arm communication. Hand and arm communication is better conveyed when most of the movement is performed by the lower body (from waist down); i.e. hips and footwork. Bachata is commonly known by many as a very sensual dance. To most it may seem that way, however, that is not what it is intended to be taken as. With that said bachata originated as a sort of ""mating call,"" if you were selected for a dance of bachata, you were chosen as a mate, two dances with the same individual, ""sealed the deal. "" The original dance style from the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean is a basic dance sequence in a full 8 count moving within a square. Dancers in the Western World later began developing a more simple pattern and added dance elements from other dances as well, the basic is also in a full 8 count, but with a side-to-side motion. Both Styles consist of 3 steps normal and then a tap step. The tap is often accompanied by a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“popÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ of the hips, and is sometimes substituted with syncopations (steps in between the beats - some similar to cha-cha-cha steps and others much different). Bachata music has an accent in rhythm at every fourth count. Often, this is when dancers will tap-step & pop their hips - this is called dancing bachata to the basic rhythm of the music (because the first step after the pop falls on the 1st beat of the measure). But bachata can be danced to different timings as well if it's danced to one particular instrument instead. The tab or 'pop' is done in the opposite direction of the last step, while the next step is taken on the same direction as the tap or pop. The dance direction changes after the tap or fourth step."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Balboa_(dance)	Balboa (dance)	Balboa	Swing dances	NA	"Balboa today is commonly used both as a term to describe a fusion of dances that originated in Southern California during the 1920s and 1930s, and also referring to a specific dance from that era that was the original Balboa (sometimes also referred to as Pure-Bal). The original Balboa dance is a form of swing dance that started as early as 1915 and gained in popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. It is danced primarily in close embrace, and is led with a full body connection. The art of Balboa is in the subtle communication between the lead and follow, including weight shifts, which most viewers cannot see. As a result, Balboa is considered more of a ""dancer's dance"" than a ""spectator's dance"". Its exact origins are obscure, especially as most of the original Balboa dancers have since died. Balboa is danced to a wide variety of tempos. Because the basic step takes up such a small space, Balboa can be danced to fast music (over 300 beats per minute). Balboa is also danced to slow music (under 100 beats per minute), which allows more time for intricate footwork and variations."	NA	NA	NA	USA

It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Ballet may also refer to a ballet dance work, which consists of the choreography and music for a ballet production. A well-known example of this is The Nutcracker, a two-act ballet that was originally choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov with a music score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Stylistic variations have emerged and evolved since the Italian Renaissance. Early variations are primarily associated with geographic origin. Examples of this are Russian ballet, French ballet, and Italian ballet. Later variations include contemporary ballet and neoclassical ballet. Perhaps the most widely known and performed ballet style is late Romantic ballet, which is a classical style that focuses on female dancers and features pointe work, flowing and precise acrobatic movements, and often presents the female dancers in traditional, short white French tutus. Ballet dance works (ballets) are choreographed and performed by trained artists, and often performed with classical music accompaniment. Early ballets preceded the invention of the proscenium stage and were performed in large chambers with the audience seated on tiers or galleries on three sides of the dance floor. Modern ballets may include mime and acting, and are usually set to music. Ballet requires years of training to learn and master, and much practice to retain proficiency. It has been taught in ballet schools around the world, which have historically used their own cultures to evolve the art. Ballet is the foundation of many types of dance.

While the blues traditionally depicts a variety of emotions, boogie-woogie is mainly associated with dancing. The lyrics of one of the earliest hits, ""Pinetop's Boogie Woogie"", consist entirely of instructions to dancers: Now, when I tell you to hold yourself, don't you move a peg. And when I tell you to get it, I want you to Boogie Woogie! It is characterized by a regular bass figure, in the left hand. The bass figure is transposed according to the chord changes. It is not strictly a solo piano style, but is also used to accompany singers and as a solo part in bands and small combos. It is sometimes called ""eight to the bar"", as much of it is written in common time (4/4) time using eighth notes. The chord progressions are typically based on I - IV - V - I (with many formal variations of it, such as I/i - IV/iv - v/I, as well as chords that lead into these ones. For the most part, boogie-woogie tunes are twelve-bar blues, although the style has been applied to popular songs such as ""Swanee River"" and hymns such as ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee"".

Fast to gain popularity in the media, the dance spread worldwide especially in South Korea, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and Japan. While diverse in the amount of variation available in the dance, b-boying consists of four primary elements: toprock, downrock, power moves, and freezes. B-boying is typically danced to hip-hop and especially breakbeats, although modern trends allow for much wider varieties of music along certain ranges of tempo and beat patterns. A practitioner of this dance is called a b-boy, b-girl, or breaker. Although the term ""breakdance"" is frequently used to refer to the dance, ""b-boying"" and ""breaking"" are the original terms.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ceroc	Ceroc	Ceroc	Swing dances;Partner dance	NA	"Ceroc is a partner dance best described as a fusion of Salsa and Jive, but without the complicated footwork. It is derived from many other dances including French Jive, Swing, Lindy Hop, and Rock and Roll, the main change being simplified footwork which makes it more accessible to beginners. The footwork and hand patterns are similar to Merengue, but with the inclusion of outward turns, multiple turns and dips. It is danced to almost any music typically 60s through to modern popular music. It is generally danced to music with 4 beats to the bar, from latest chart hits to big band music and everything between, in a wide variety of tempos from slow to very fast. Some styles may concentrate on particular musical styles, such as swing. It does not require special clothes, though for both men and women, smooth soled (non-rubberised) shoes that are easy to turn/spin in are highly recommended. Ceroc is, like many partner dances, traditionally a male-led dance. Despite this tradition many female dancers today also learn the lead role, even though few male dancers learn the follow role. This is usually because Ceroc events have more female participants than male ones, and many males are less comfortable engaging in a partner dance with a member of the same sex than females are. It is sometimes suggested that Ceroc is suited to any type of music, but it best suits a tempo ranging from around 100 - 150 beats per minute. Outside the UK, Ceroc is less common, although it is very popular in Australia and New Zealand, and is slowly spreading to other areas of the world. The name 'Ceroc' is said to derive from the French ""C'est le roc"" (it's roc), used to describe rock n' roll dancing in France."	NA	NA	NA	England

The Cha Cha requires small steps and lots of hip motion (Cuban motion), as it is danced in 4/4 time. The fourth beat is split into two, giving it the characteristic 2,3,4 & 1 rhythm. Therefore, five steps are danced to four beats as in the ""One, two, cha cha cha"" rhythm. The basic components of the Cha Cha are triple steps and rock steps. Quick, small steps must be maintained throughout the dance. The distinctive movements of the hips result from the constant bending and straightening of the knees. Dancers must synchronize each movement as they dance parallel to one another. Because the Cha Cha is very similar to the Rumba and Mambo, several steps coincide with the steps of these dances. The main difference between the dances is that the ""slow"" steps of the Rumba and the Mambo are replaced with a triple step in the Cha Cha.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Country_dancing	Country Dance	Country Dance	Folk_dances;Social_dance;European_folk_dances	NA	"A country dance is a social dance form in which two or more couples dance together in a set. In the course of the dance each dancer dances to his or her partner and each couple dances to the other couples in the set. The longways set in which the men form a line facing the women, who form a second line is the most common formation. However, the English term country dance, first coined in print by John Playford of London in 1651, has always applied not only to dances in the longways formation, but to square dances, ""round about the room"" sets (not to be confused with ""couple"" dances) and even triangular sets- for three couples. Country dancing is generally recognized to be a form of folk dance, that is a traditional dance of the people, it should be clearly understood that it is a dance for participation rather than demonstration. Its participatory nature sets country dancing apart from folk dance forms such as Clogging- which is primarily demonstration dancing. The social concourse implicit in the communal nature of country dancing also distinguishes it from the ballroom dances, couple dances in which dancers dance intimately with their partners but independently of the other couples on the dance floor. North American Contradance is derived from the English form country dance, though in American usage the term appears to be narrowly applied to the longways set. The Appalachian music associated with American contra-dance is to this day recognisably Anglo-celtic in form."	NA	NA	NA	England

Cumbia began as a courtship dance practiced among the African population, which was later mixed with European instruments and musical characteristics.

Its initial audiences were club-goers from the African American, Latino, gay, and psychedelic communities in New York City and Philadelphia during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco also was a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. Women embraced disco as well, and the music eventually expanded to several other popular groups of the time. In what is considered a forerunner to disco style clubs, New York City DJ David Mancuso opened The Loft, a members-only private dance club set in his own home, in February 1970. Allmusic claims some have argued that Isaac Hayes and Barry White were playing what would be called disco music as early as 1971. According to the music guide, there is disagreement as to what the first disco song was. Claims have been made for Manu Dibango's ""Soul Makossa"" (1972), Jerry Butler's ""One Night Affair"" (1972), the Hues Corporation's ""Rock the Boat"" (1973), George McCrae's ""Rock Your Baby"" (1974), and ""Kung Fu Fighting"" (1974) by Biddu and Carl Douglas. The first article about disco was written in September 1973 by Vince Aletti for Rolling Stone magazine. In 1974 New York City's WPIX-FM premiered the first disco radio show. Musical influences include funk, Latin and soul music. The disco sound has soaring, often reverberated vocals over a steady ""four-on-the-floor"" beat, an eighth note (quaver) or 16th note (semi-quaver) hi-hat pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a prominent, syncopated electric bass line sometimes consisting of octaves. The Fender Jazz Bass is often associated with disco bass lines, because the instrument itself has a very prominent ""voice"" in the musical mix. In most disco tracks, strings, horns, electric pianos, and electric guitars create a lush background sound. Orchestral instruments such as the flute are often used for solo melodies, and lead guitar is less frequently in disco than in rock. Many disco songs employ the use of electronic instruments such as synthesizers. Well-known late 1970s disco performers included Donna Summer, The Bee Gees, KC and the Sunshine Band, The Trammps, Van McCoy, Gloria Gaynor, The Village People, Chic, and The JacksonsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½the latter which first dipped its toes into disco as The Jackson 5. Summer would become the first well-known and most popular disco artistÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½eventually having the title ""The Queen of Disco"" bestowed upon her by various criticsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½and would also play a part in pioneering the electronic sound that later became a prominent element of disco. While performers and singers garnered the lion's share of public attention, producers working behind the scenes played an equal, if not more important role in disco, since they often wrote the songs and created the innovative sounds and production techniques that were part of the ""disco sound. "" Many non-disco artists recorded disco songs at the height of disco's popularity, and films such as Saturday Night Fever and Thank God It's Friday contributed to disco's rise in mainstream popularity. According to music writer Piero Scaruffi, the disco phenomenon spread quickly because the ""collective ecstasy"" of disco was cathartic and regenerative and led to freedom of expression. Disco was the last mass popular music movement that was driven by the baby boom generation. Disco music was a worldwide phenomenon, but its popularity declined in the United States in the late 1970s. On July 12, 1979, an anti-disco protest in Chicago called ""Disco Demolition Night"" had shown that an angry backlash against disco and its culture had emerged in the United States. In the subsequent months and years, many musical acts associated with disco struggled to get airplay on the radio. A few artists still managed to score disco hits in the early 1980s, but the term ""disco"" became unfashionable in the new decade and was eventually replaced by ""dance music"", ""dance pop"", and other identifiers. Although the production techniques have changed, many successful acts since the 1970s have retained the basic disco beat and mentality, and dance clubs have remained popular."

First mentioned in literature in 1774, the genre grew out of Andalusian and Romani music and dance styles. In recent years flamenco has become popular all over the world and is taught in many countries: in Japan there are more academies than there are in Spain. On November 16, 2010 UNESCO declared flamenco one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.	NA	NA	NA	Spain		
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foxtrot_(Dance)	Foxtrot (Dance)	Foxtrot	Ballroom dance	NA	Foxtrot is a smooth dance, traveling around the line of dance. The long walking movements involve a subtle rise & fall action. Turning movements are similar to Waltz, but with a more moderate rise and fall, and more length-wise action. International Foxtrot syllabus has only closed dance position but in American Foxtrot, both open and closed dance positions are allowed. The Foxtrot originally started with slow and quick steps but soon evolved to include twinkles and chasses. The Foxtrot is danced to music written in 4/4 time with the first and third beats of each measure more heavily accented. It is danced in combinations of slow and quick steps, with each slow step taking two beats and each quick step one beat of music. Therefore, a dance basic figure in slow, slow, quick, quick rhythm takes one and a half measures, while a dance figure in slow, quick, quick rhythm takes one measure. There are 3 kinds of Foxtrot - social or rhythm foxtrot which is the easiest for beginners (SSQQ), International style Slow Foxtrot, and American style Foxtrot. The latter two are more complicated dances and the step patterns have many different rhythms, not just SQQ, or SSQQ, or QQS, etc. Foxtrot is extremely versatile and can be danced to a variety of musical styles and tempi. In competitions, however, it is danced to music at a tempo of 29 to 34 measure per minute depending on the level. Foxtrot is a ballroom dance that was popularized by actor Harry Fox.

These mainly include locking, popping, and electric boogaloo. Though many of these dance styles have been incorporated into hip hop culture and are often seen danced to hip hop music, they were originally (and are still) danced to funk music. One of the reasons that the term funk styles first appeared was to give these dances their own identity and avoid them being primarily associated with breaking which is from New York.	NA	NA	NA	USA

It includes a wide range of styles primarily breaking, locking, and popping which were created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the United States. The television show Soul Train and the 1980s films Breakin', Beat Street, and Wild Style showcased these crews and dance styles in their early stages; therefore, giving hip-hop mainstream exposure. The dance industry responded with a commercial, studio-based version of hip-hopÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½sometimes called new styleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½and a hip-hop influenced style of jazz dance called jazz-funk. Classically trained dancers developed these studio styles in order to create choreography from the hip-hop dances that were performed on the street. Because of this development, hip-hop dance is practiced in both dance studios and outdoor spaces. The commercialization of hip-hop dance continued into the 1990s and 2000s with the production of several other television shows and movies such as The Grind, Planet B-Boy, Rize, StreetDance 3D, America's Best Dance Crew, Saigon Electric, the Step Up film series, and The LXD, a web series. Though the dance is established in entertainment, including mild representation in theater, it maintains a strong presence in urban neighborhoods which has led to the creation of street dance derivatives turfing, krumping, and jerkin'. 1980s films, television shows, and the Internet have contributed to introducing hip-hop dance outside of the United States. Since being exposed, educational opportunities and dance competitions have helped to maintain its presence abroad. Europe host several international hip-hop competitions such as the UK B-Boy Championships, Juste Debout, and EuroBattle. Australia host a team-based competition called World Supremacy Battlegrounds and Japan host a two-on-two competition called World Dance Colosseum. What distinguishes hip-hop dance from other forms of dance is that it is often freestyle (improvisational) in nature and hip-hop dance crews often engage in freestyle dance competitionsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½colloquially referred to as battles. Crews, freestyling, and battles are identifiers of this style. Hip-hop dance can be a form of entertainment or a hobby.

The etymology of its name is much disputed. It may derived from the French meringue, a dessert made from whipped egg whites and sugar, but is equally likely to be related to similar West African words related to dance and music. Merengue is first mentioned in the Dominican Republic in 1854. In the Dominican Republic it was promoted by Rafael Trujillo, the dictator from the 1930 to 1961, who turned it into the country's national music and dance style. In the United States it was first popularized by New York-based groups and bandleaders like Rafael Petiton Guzman, beginning in the 1930s, and Angel Viloria y su Conjunto TÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­pico CibaeÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±o in the 1950s. It was during the Trujillo era that the merengue ""Compadre Pedro Juan"", by Luis Alberti, became an international hit and standardized the 2-part form of the merengue. Internationally known merengue singers and groups include Fernando Villalona, Juan Luis Guerra, Eddy Herrera, ToÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±o Rosario & Los Hermanos Rosario, Los Toros Band, Sergio Vargas, Wilfrido Vargas, Johnny Ventura, Bonny Cepeda, Miriam Cruz & Las Chicas Del Can, Joseito Mateo, Luis Ovalles, the aforementioned Angel Viloria, El Cieguito de Nagua, Kinito Mendez, Ravel, Jossie Esteban y la Patrulla 15, Pochy y su Cocoband, Cuco Valoy, The Freddy Kenton Orquestra, RamÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³n Orlando, Sandy Reyes, Rasputin, Peter Cruz, Alex Bueno, Aramis Camilo, Jochy HernÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡ndez, El Zafiro, Dioni Fernandez, The New York Band, Anibal Bravo, Conjunto Quisqueya, Olga TaÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³n, Gisselle, and GrupomanÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­a. Milly Quezada is known as the Queen of Merengue. The popularity of Merengue is growing fast in Venezuela. Venezuelan merengueros include Roberto Antonio, Miguel Moly, Natusha, Los Melodicos. Merengue is also popular in the coastal city of Guayaquil in Ecuador. The merengue produced in New York has become very popular among the lovers of this rhythm.

Rockabilly is NOT a linear dance [i.e. danced in a slot or along a line of dance], it is a rotary dance [i.e. the follower generally assumes a position and the leader moves around her].	4 beats in each bar (measure)	42-56 beats per minute		USA	"Albert Lee;Alvin Lee;Bill Haley;Billy ""Crash"" Craddock;Billy Fury;Bob Luman;Boz Boorer;Brenda Lee;Buddy Knox;Carl Smith (country musician);Chris Isaak;Dave Alvin;David Frizzell;Eddie Cochran;Eilen Jewell;Glen Hardin;Hal Willis;Ian Stuart Donaldson;Jerry Reed;Johnny Horton;Junior Parker;Link Wray;Red Foley;Slim Jim Phantom;The Big Bopper;Wallis Bird;Mike Ness;Bonnie Lou;Brian Setzer;Charlie Rich;Dave Gonzalez (guitarist);Doyle Holly;Duke Robillard;Ersel Hickey;Gene Summers;Gene Vincent;Hasil Adkins;James Intveld;Janis Martin;Johnny Carroll;Legendary Stardust Cowboy;Maria McKee;Marty Robbins;Marvin Rainwater;Moon Mullican;Patricia Day;Rod Bernard;Ronnie Dawson (musician);Roy Head;Shirley Collie Nelson;Skeets McDonald;Stephen A.

Like all styles of Rock 'n' Roll dancing, the man commences on his left foot while the lady commences on her right. It is usually danced 4 steps to 3 beats of music. The basic move for the man is - step left (slow) - step right (slow) - rock step (quick - quick) The rock step (or back step) is where the man rocks back and forward on his left foot. It is counted as one beat and involves two short quick steps. The rhythm is counted as slow, slow, quick, quick. 4 Step Rock 'n' Roll has a side to side rhythm, and also a back/forward rhythm. 4 Step Rock 'n' Roll is also known as American Jive or RnR. It is adapted from Ballroom Jive. The two sets of triple steps in Ballroom Jive have been replaced by two individual steps in 4 Step Rock 'n' Roll. It is easy to learn and the fastest growing style of rock n roll dancing.	4 beats in each bar (measure)	36-48 beats per minute	Slow, Slow, Quick, Quick	USA	"Al Jardine;Alan Lancaster;Albert Lee;Alvin Stardust;Bert Berns;Bill Haley;Bill Payne;Billy Fury;Bon Scott;Boz Boorer;Brian Johnson;Bruce Johnston;Chris Isaak;Colin James;CzesÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡aw Niemen;D.

In some contexts, ""rumba"" is used as shorthand for Afro-Cuban rumba, a group of dances related to the rumba genre of Afro-Cuban music. The most common Afro-Cuban rumba is the guaguancÃƒÂ³. The other Afro-Cuban rumbas are Yambu and Columbia. In other contexts, ""rumba"" refers to ballroom-rumba, one of the ballroom dances which occurs in social dance and in international competitions. In this sense, rumba is the slowest of the five competitive International Latin dances: the paso doble, the samba, the cha-cha-cha and the jive being the others. This ballroom rumba was derived from a Cuban rhythm and dance called the bolero-son; the international style was derived from studies of dance in Cuba in the pre-revolutionary period."	4 beats in each bar (measure)	25-27 beats per minute	Quick, Quick, Slow	Cuba	Vetcho Lolas	Aida;Circular Hip Twists;Closed Hip Twist;Continuous Hip Twists;Cuban Rocks;Curarachas;Fan;Fencing;Hand to Hand;Hip Twists;Hockey Stick;Natural Opening Out;New York;Opening Out from Reverse Top;Opening Out to R & L;Progressive Walks;Reverse Top;Rope Spinning;Side Steps;Sliding Doors;Spot Turns;Three Alemanas;Three ThreesUnderarm Turns

In essence, Salsa is no more than a step forward and a step back, with a rock in between. It's largely a partner dance, but with many fancy ""shines"" that can be thrown in individually. It's important to note first that while Salsa music uses 4/4 time, the dance does not have the usual 1,2,3,4 step count that many dances use. Instead, it leaves out the 4 and 8 count, creating a slight pause. Also note that the male and female steps are directly reversed to allow fluid movement. There are many different styles of Salsa dance popular today. Each style represents the cultural preferences of dancers. You can be sure that Salsa dancers from other cities, neighborhoods, or other times, dance differently. Each Salsa dance style has its own distinct characteristics. The names of the styles are based on the people or geographic area that popularized them. Also, Salsa can be danced while accenting different beats in the music."	4 beats in each bar (measure)	beats per minute		Puerto Rico		Back Spot Turn;Backflip Dip;Check with Turn;Copa;Corkscrew;Cross Body Dip;Cross Body into Outside Turn;Cross Body Lead with Turn;Cross Body with Clockwise Turn;Cucaracha ;Death Drop;Double Cross Body Lead;Double Reverse Cuban Turn;Double Sombrero;Drop Catch;Enchufla;Flash Dip;Floor Sweep;Hair Comes;Hammerlock;Hoops;Ladies Double Turns;Ladies Walk Around;Limbo;Man's Underarm Turn to Right;Pick The Girl Up;Quick Dip;Reverse Copa;Reverse Cross Body Lead with Turn;Roller Blind;Ropes;Shoulder Drop to Ladies Cuban;Shoulder Lift;Sombrero;Tornado Spin Dip;Travelling Righ Hand Turn;Underarm Turn with Double Head Loop;Waist Duck

It is recognized around the world as a symbol of Brazil and the Brazilian Carnival. Considered one of the most popular Brazilian cultural expressions, samba has become an icon of Brazilian national identity. The Bahian Samba de Roda (dance circle), which became a UNESCO Heritage of Humanity in 2005, is the main root of the samba carioca, the samba that is played and danced in Rio de Janeiro. 65x50px Uva de caminhÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o noicon Composed by Assis Valente, recorded by Carmem Miranda in 1939.

The modern samba that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century is basically 2/4 tempo varied with the conscious use of chorus sung to the sound of palms and batucada rhythm, adding one or more parts or stanzas of declaratory verses. Traditionally, the samba is played by strings (cavaquinho and various types of guitar) and various percussion instruments such as tamborim. Influenced by American orchestras in vogue since the Second World War and the cultural impact of US music post-war, samba began to use trombones, trumpets, choros, flutes, and clarinets. In addition to rhythm and bar, samba brings a whole historical culture of food, varied dances (miudinho, coco, samba de roda, and pernada), parties, clothes such as linen shirts, and the NAIF painting of established names such as Nelson Sargento, Guilherme de Brito, and Heitor dos Prazeres. Anonymous community artists, including painters, sculptors, designers, and stylists, make the clothes, costumes, carnival floats, and cars, opening the doors of schools of samba. The Samba National Day is celebrated on December 2. The date was established at the initiative of Luis Monteiro da Costa, an Alderman of Salvador, in honor of Ary Barroso. He composed ""Na Baixa do Sapateiro"" even though he had never been in Bahia. Thus 2 December marked the first visit of Ary Barroso to Salvador. Initially, this day was celebrated only in Salvador, but eventually it turned into a national holiday. Samba is a root style in Southeastern Brazil and Northeast Brazil, especially in Rio de Janeiro, SÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o Paulo, Salvador and Belo Horizonte. Its importance as Brazil's national music transcends region, however; samba schools, samba musicians and carnival organizations centered around the performance of samba exist in every region of the country and, while regional musics prevail in other regions (for instance, in Southern Brazil, Center-West Brazil, and all of the Brazilian countryside, Sertanejo, or Brazilian country music, is the most popular style). Since Rio de Janeiro is the most popular Brazilian city worldwide, usually samba is used to identify Brazilians as part of the same national culture."

Square dances were first documented in 17th century England but were also quite common in France and throughout Europe. They came to North America with the European settlers and have undergone considerable development there. In some countries and regions, through preservation and repetition, square dances have attained the status of a folk dance. The Western American square dance may be the most widely known form worldwide except dances from China and India, possibly due to its association in the 20th century with the romanticized image of the American cowboy. Square dancing is, therefore, strongly associated with the United States of America. Nineteen US states have designated it as their official state dance. The various square dance movements are based on the steps and figures used in traditional folk dances and social dances from many countries. Some of these traditional dances include Morris dance, English Country Dance, Caledonians and the quadrille. Square dancing is enjoyed by people around the world, and people around the world are involved in the continuing development of this form of dance. In most American forms of square dance, the dancers are prompted or cued through a sequence of steps (square dance choreography) by a caller to the beat (and, in some traditions, the phrasing) of music. The caller may be one of the dancers or musicians, but nowadays is more likely to be on stage, giving full attention to directing the dancers. The American folk music revival in New York City in the 1950s was rooted in the resurgent interest in square dancing and folk dancing there in the 1940s, which gave musicians such as Pete Seeger popular exposure.

The best known of these dances is the Lindy Hop, a popular partner dance that originated in Harlem in 1927 and is still danced today. Lindy was a fusion of many dances that preceded it or were popular during its development but is mainly based on jazz, tap, breakaway and Charleston. While the majority of swing dances began in African American communities as vernacular African American dances, some swing era dances, such as the Foxtrot and the Balboa, developed in white communities. Swing dance was not always used as a general blanket term for a group of dances. Historically, the term Swing applied with no connection to the Swing era, or its Swing music. The Texas Tommy Swing dance first appeared in print in 1910 in San Francisco (Barbary Coast). Into the 1920s and 1930s every major city had their own way to dance, based on regional roots, and influences. Los Angeles had its own form of what they called ""Swing dance"" which came from Charleston, Fox Trot, and Jig Trot influenced footwork. In Chicago and in the south they had their own style of Swing, which was more two-step based, and most of these regional swing dances gave way to various influences, such as other dance forms of dance but also the decline of dance bands and partner dancing after WW2. Swing jazz features the syncopated timing associated with African American and West African music and dance ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ a combination of crotchets and quavers that many swing dancers interpret as 'triple steps' and 'steps' ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ yet also introduces changes in the way these rhythms were played ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ as a distinct delay or 'relaxed' approach to timing. Today there are swing-dance scenes in many countries. Lindy Hop is often the most popular, though each city and country prefers various dances to different degrees. Each local swing-dance community has a distinct local culture and defines ""swing dance"", and the ""appropriate"" music to accompany it, in different ways."	NA	NA	NA	Africa

Although walking movements dominate, Tango walks, having a ""stalking"" or ""sneaking"" character, are unlike the walks of other ballroom dances. Movements are sometimes slow and slithery, and other times sharp and stacatto, such as a quick foot flick or a sharp head snap to promenade position. Tango has the same counter clockwise flow of movement around the dance floor, but with a lesser sense of urgency in comparison to the smoother and more continuous ballroom dances. American Style Tango, especially at highly-developed skill levels, makes great use of open and alternate dance positions to further showcase Tango's dramatic nature. Ballroom Tango is a ballroom dance that branched away from its original Argentine roots by allowing European, American, Hollywood, and competitive (a.k.a dancesport) influences into the style and execution of the dance."	4 beats in each bar (measure)	30-32 beats per minute	Slow, Slow, Quick, Quick, Slow	Argentine	Rosita Melo	Back Corte;Back Open Promenade;Back Rocks;Basic Reverse Turn;Basic Walk;Brush Tap;Closed Promendade;Fallaway Four Step;Fallaway Promenade;Fallaway Reverse and Slip Pivot;Five Step;Four Step;Four Step Change;Natural Twist Turn;Open Promenade;Open Reverse Turn to Outside Swivel;Open Reverse Turn, Lady In-Line;Open Reverse Turn, Lady Outside;Oversway;Progressive Side Step;Promenade Link;Reverse Endings;Reverse Outside Swivel;Rock Turn;The Chase

As such, it is also commonly considered to be a form of music. Two major variations on tap dance exist: rhythm (Jazz) tap and Broadway tap. Broadway tap focuses more on the dance. It is widely performed as a part of musical theater. Rhythm tap focuses more on musicality, and practitioners consider themselves to be a part of the Jazz tradition. The sound is made by shoes with a metal ""tap"" on the heel and toe. Tap shoes can be bought at most dance shops. There are different brands of shoes which sometimes differ in the way they sound. ""Soft-Shoe"" is a rhythm form of tap dancing that doesn't require special shoes, and while rhythm is generated by tapping of the feet, it also uses sliding of the feet (even sometimes using scattered sand on the stage to enhance the sound of the performer's sliding feet) more often than modern rhythm tap. It preceded what is currently considered to be modern tap, but has since declined in popularity."	NA	NA	NA	USA		Step-heel;Heel-Step;Stamp;Ball-change;Hop;Spring;Drop;Brush

Typically the follower walks into new patterns traveling forward on counts ""1"" and ""2"" of each basic pattern, rather than rocking back.
